### üé® Color Scheme and Font Choices
The color scheme is derived from **Tailwind CSS palette**, designed to reflect a **dark, bold, and modern restaurant theme**:
- **Primary Background:** `#111827` (Tailwind's `bg-gray-900`) for navbar and section backgrounds
- **Accent Color:** `#fb923c` (Tailwind's `orange-400`) used on icons, hovers, and highlights
- **Text Colors:** `#ffffff` (pure white) for headings, `#d1d5db` (`gray-300`) for body and nav links
- **Hover Backgrounds:** `#1f2937` (`gray-800`) for mobile nav buttons

**Font Choices:**
- **Headings**: Elegant serif like `Playfair Display`
- **Body Text**: Clean sans-serif like `Inter` or `Poppins` for readability

### üì± Responsiveness Strategy
The landing page follows a **mobile-first design approach**, built using **Tailwind CSS**‚Äôs responsive utility classes (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, etc.).  
- **Navbar** transitions into a **hamburger menu** on smaller screens  
- **Grid and flexbox** layouts adapt testimonial cards, images, and sections for all screen sizes  
- Tailwind‚Äôs utility-first methodology offers precise control over layout, spacing, and typography without writing custom media queries

### üéûÔ∏è Animation Approach
Animations are used to **enhance user engagement** without compromising performance:   
- **Framer Motion**: For smooth, declarative animations in the Hero section and call-to-action elements  
- Tailwind's built-in `transition`, `hover`, and `duration` utilities provide subtle hover interactions and button effects  
All animations are optimized to be lightweight and non-distracting, supporting performance and UX.

### üõ†Ô∏è Libraries or Frameworks Used and Reasons
- **React (JSX)**: Modular structure allows clean and reusable component development (e.g., Navbar, Hero, Footer)  
- **Tailwind CSS**: Enables fast styling with a consistent, responsive, and maintainable utility-first approach   
- **Framer Motion**: Offers powerful, smooth animations with full control in React components  
- **Lucide React**: For clean, customizable icons that blend well with the design system  

These tools were selected to ensure a **custom, scalable, and performant** landing page without relying on templates or bulky frameworks.
